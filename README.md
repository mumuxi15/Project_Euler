2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N (<four million), find the sum of the even-valued terms.

6. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

   $1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385$

   The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

   $(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025$

   Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.

   Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

12. The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

   1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

   Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

    1: 1
    3: 1,3
    6: 1,2,3,6
   10: 1,2,5,10
   15: 1,3,5,15
   21: 1,3,7,21
   28: 1,2,4,7,14,28


   We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

   What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

13. Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

   ```python
   s = sum([int(input()) for l in range(int(input()))])
   print (str(s)[0:10])
   ```

14. The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

   n → n/2 (n is even)
   n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

   Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

   13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

   It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

   Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

   What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

   ```python
   print (sum([int(a) for a in str(2**1000)])
   ```

17. If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

   If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

   NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

18. By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

   3
   7 4
   2 4 6
   8 5 9 3

   That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

   Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

   NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

   ```python
   #bottom-up approach 
   def Euler18(A):
       n = len(A)
       for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
           for j in range(len(A[i])):
               A[i][j] = max(A[i][j]+A[i+1][j],A[i][j]+A[i+1][j+1])
       print (A[0][0])

19. You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

   - 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
   - Thirty days has September,
     April, June and November.
     All the rest have thirty-one,
     Saving February alone,
     Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
     And on leap years, twenty-nine.
   - A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

20. *n*! means *n* × (*n* − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

   For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
   and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

   Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

   ```python
   def Euler20(x):
   #	sum of digits of x!
   	p = 1
   	for i in range(1,x+1):
   		p = p*i
   	print (sum([int(x) for x in str(p)]))
   ```

21. Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a)=b and d(b)=a, where a!=b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

   For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55 and 110; therefore d(220)=284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,2,4,71 and 142; so d(284)=220.

   Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000. 31626

   ```python
   def find_all_factors(x):
       factors=[]
       for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(x))+1,1):
           if x % i ==0:
               factors += [i,x//i]
       return set(factors)
   
   def Euler21(N):
       maximum = N
       records = [0]*N
       amicable = []
       for i in range(3,maximum):
           factors = find_all_factors(i)
           sum_factors = 1+sum(factors)
           
           if sum_factors>i:  #only record sum > its own
               records[i] = sum_factors
   #           print (i, '  - - -   record - - ')
           elif sum_factors<i: #check records
               if records[sum_factors] ==i:
                   amicable+=[i,sum_factors]
   #               print ('sum <  i  ',records[sum_factors])

22. Using [names.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0022_names.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

   For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3+15+12+9+14=53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938×53=49714.

   What is the total of all the name scores in the file? 871198282

   ```python
   names = ["HOSEA","SHAD","SANTO","RUDOLF","ROLF","REY","RENALDO","MARCELLUS","LUCIUS","KRISTOFER","BOYCE","BENTON","HAYDEN","HARLAND","ARNOLDO","RUEBEN","LEANDRO","KRAIG","JERRELL", ...]
   def mapping_func22(name):
       return sum([ord(x.lower())-96 for x in name])
   
   def Euler22(names):
       names = sorted(names)
       score = 0
       for i in range(len(names)):
           score += mapping_func22(names[i])*(1+names.index(names[i]))
       print (score)
   ```

23. A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1+2+4+7+14=28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

   A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

   As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1+2+3+4+6=16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

   Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. 4179871

   ```python
   def sum_of_divisors(x):
       s = 0
       for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(x))+1,1):
           if x % i ==0:
               s += i if i==x//i else x//i+i
       return s+1
   
   def Euler23(N=28123):
       # all numbers > 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers    
       abundant = [i for i in range(3,N) if sum_of_divisors(i)>i ]
           
       is_abundant_sum = [False]*(N)
       for i in abundant:
           for j in abundant:
               z = i+j
               if z <N and is_abundant_sum[z] is False:
                   is_abundant_sum[z]=True
                   
       return sum([i for i, x in enumerate(is_abundant_sum) if x is False])

24. A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

   012  021  102  120  201  210

   What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

   ```python
   ```

   

25. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

   F~n~ + F~n-1~ + F~n-2~ where F~1~ = 1 and F~2~ = 1

   Hence the first 12 terms will be: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144

   The 12th term, F~12~ , is the first term to contain three digits.

   What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
